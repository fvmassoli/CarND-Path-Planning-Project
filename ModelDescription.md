# Project Introduction

The goal of the project is to implement a trajectory planner ables to plan drivable trajectories while respecting some restrictions as max jerk, max speed, etc...

The project is divided into three main files main.cpp, vehicle.cpp, vehicle.h.

The two files pid.cpp and pid.h are not currently used into the project. The idea was to use PID to control the speed of the car.
